# Contributing

We welcome contributors of all skill levels! Any and every
contribution such as fixing spelling, adding on to documentation, or
finding bugs is highly appreciated. Feel free to reach out to me at
`ny585 at nyu.edu` if you need help getting started. 

## Getting Started


1. Fork the repo
2. Set up dependencies (as detailed in [README](/README.md))
3. Contribute! For ideas, feel free to check out items in the Issues
   tab
4. When you're ready, open a pull request to the main repo
5. After some revisions and minor tweaks, your PR will be merged and
   you'll have officially contributed to an open source project!
   
## Conventions/Style

We use Prettier on the default settings to format the front end
code. When in doubt, consult
[AirBnB](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for style. For Ruby, we
generally follow [AirBnB](https://github.com/airbnb/ruby) as well.

For JavaScript, we prefer ES6, so that means `const` and `let` over
`var`, fat arrow functions, etc.

Please make pull requests single issue. I know, it's tempting to fix
multiple issues at once, but it makes the reviewer's job more
complicated and potential reverts trickier.

Also, please try to keep pull requests small. There's no specific
cutoff, but if it takes half an hour to just read, chances are it's
too complicated. Remember, incremental change is better than no change
at all. Exceptions include major refactoring that **must** happen.


## Codebase Layout

If you're confused on how the code is laid out or how to start reading
the codebase, read the [Codebase Guide](/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md)
