# School Seeker

School Seeker is a website that helps you find the perfect fit for
college. It uses a combination of crowd sourced reviews, data
collection and rankings to help find the best possible place to spend
your next 4 years.

School Seeker is built using Ruby on Rails with a React front end. It
uses GraphQL to communicate with Apollo on the front end and GraphQL
Ruby on the back end.

To run locally:

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (at least version 6, but
ideally 8)

2. Install [Ruby 2.5.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
([rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) highly recommended)

3. Install dependencies by running `./install.sh`

The front end should be running on http://localhost:3002 and the back
end should be running on http://localhost:3000.
